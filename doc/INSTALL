			phpMrtgAdmin - INSTALL
			======================

============
REQUIREMENTS
============

	* MRTG 2.11.1 or newer
	* Apache
	* PHP 4.3.9 or newer
	* PEAR packages
	* any web-browser


============
INTRODUCTION
============

phpMrtgAdmin is the flexible PHP-based web-tool for monitoring of 
MRTG-created graphs. 

The main features of phpMrtgAdmin are: 
	1. no any databases
	2. customizable web-interface based on using of templates
	3. presentation of dynamically changed of MRTG data set
	4. show log-file as HTML and CSV-files
	5. calculate traffic volume for time period

Dynamically generated pages can be consider as a slight imperfection of 
tool because of the each page generated once again. 


==================
BASIC INSTALLATION
==================

NOTE: For complete installation and working You need have installed MRTG 
Apache, and PHP.

They can be downloaded from their home pages:
MRTG	-	http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/
Apache	-	http://httpd.apache.org/
PHP	-	http://php.net/
PEAR 	- 	some packages from http://pear.php.net/


These are generic installation instructions.

1. Untar or unzip the distribution in Your webserver's document root:

	tar -xvzf phpMrtgAdmin_x.x.tar.gz

2. Turn up the MRTG so that it will save HTML, log and graph files at 
folders arranged by systems. There is good idea to keep configuration of 
each system within individual file and include them into the global 
configuration file. 
For example:

	### Global Config Options

	EnableIPv6: no
	WorkDir: /usr/local/apache/www/mrtg

	Include: /usr/local/mrtg/cfg/Cisco7206-mrtg.cfg
	Include: /usr/local/mrtg/cfg/AS5350-mrtg.cfg
	Include: /usr/local/mrtg/cfg/PIX515-mrtg.cfg

Each XXX-mrtg.cfg file may be generated by instruction such as

	/usr/local/mrtg/bin/cfgmaker --subdirs=XXX community@router

3. Under Unix-like operation systems You have to permit to Apache 
read/write  access to the /usr/local/apache/www/Core/Setup/sheet.ini
It is nessecary to correct save/delete displayable information. 

4. Apply accessibility and permissions to your MRTG web-pages
(such as Apache's mod_auth and mod_expires modules)

5. Define available IPs in the 'availedit' parameter at the section [IP] 
of /usr/local/apache/www/Core/Setup/Setup.ini file

6. Start Your Apache server, open web-page <http://www.host.domain> and 
begin to construct sheets. 


======================
LOCALHOST INSTALLATION
======================

As an another case of phpMrtgAdmin usage is a localhost on the isolated 
computer. Many people offer some "many-in-one" packages with webserver, 
one or more server-side scripting laguages and sql-server. Usually there 
is a bunch of Apache+Perl+PHP+MySQL, for example: 

	(i)	http://denwer.ru/
	(ii)	http://manlix.ru/
	(iii)	http://myserver.webheim.com/
	(iv)	http://devside.net/
	(v)	http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html
	(vi)	http://www.indigostar.com/microweb.htm
	(vii)	http://home.lanck.net/mf/srv/index.htm
	(viii)	etc

NOTE: phpMrtgAdmin is fully produced and tested within (i) 
http://denwer.ru/ under Windows and successfully deployed to Linux system.
